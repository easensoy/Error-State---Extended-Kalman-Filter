# Error-State---Extended-Kalman-Filter

This project is all about implementation of an EKF for sensor fusion and estimation, using IMU, GNSS, and LIDAR measurements to estimate the vehicle's position, velocity, and orientation. The EKF combines the measurements with a motion model to provide accurate and consistent estimates of the vehicle's state.
